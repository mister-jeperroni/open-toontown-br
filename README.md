# Open Toontown PT-BR
This repository contains the code for Open Toontown PT-BR. The project is a fork of [Open Toontown](https://github.com/open-toontown/open-toontown) which is based on the closed game Disney's Toontown Online.

## Setup
After cloning the repository, you will need to clone the [resources](https://github.com/mister-jeperroni/resources) repository into the `src` folder in the directory where you cloned the source code repository.

Next, you'll need to install and use a specific version of Panda3D, which includes `libotp` and `libtoontown`. You can use the pre-compiled installers for your operating system here:

## Starting the Server and Game
